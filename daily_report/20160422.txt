    The main content of today is to learn shell script:
Format:
1.the first line :#! /bin/bash    state what the shell name of using the script;
2.program description ,includes the description of the script content and function,
 version information, author, date of establishment and so on;
3. main environmental variables
4. the main part of the program
5.inform the implementation of results
In shell script operation:
Reading, toltal= ($space (spaces $firstnu*$secnu spaces))   display and unexpected
 symbols. (near grammar errors;
Changed to toltal= ($(space$firstnu*$secnua space)) running the show, 23X2: command
 not found
Changed to toltal= ($(($firstnu*$secnu)) The result of 23X2 operation display
 is ===> 46.
       This obviously reading legend feel that space, but up and running is not so
 return a responsibility, this shows that I still have to practice!
