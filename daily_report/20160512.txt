    Today I red the windows batch processing script, the new findings were as
follows, the need to pay attention to:
    1, @echo off
    Is not in the DOS program, but in the DOS batch processing. DOS of the year,
 all operations are used keyboard command to complete, when every time you enter
 the same command can put so many commands save for a batch processing, from then
 on, as long as the operation of the batch processing, equivalent to hit a few
 lines, dozens of the command line.
    DOS in the run batch processing, will in turn execute each command in the 
batch, and will display on the monitor, if you don't want to let them show, you
 can add a "echo  off".Of course, the "echo off" is also an order, it will show
 itself, if not even this display, add in front of a "@".
 
    2, /b exit
    xit the current batch script
 
    3, rd     
    another way is rmdir from ReMakeDirectory
