  Today I had solved the problem that TC70GA machine could not start;
  At the beginning ,Zhouzhou according to the error comment out something. connected 
to find the image board or the machine can not burn. Later, I think it might be 
short of the four _test . Back in the office after, put the four _test to the
  public server, and then into the workshop will put the four test into the computer
 in order to burn the image folder, again burning to the board, in the process of
 the operation showed no any errors, burn a good found still can not boot. I felt
 it may be the board hardware problems, and suggested her change a good TC70GA 
board. Then, I used the command fastboot erase sbl1 erase sbl1, then I would make
 this package image burned into. If it could burn in and could boot ,It would prove
 our software package had not any problem. After doing this  found in this board 
was to burn the boot! So, our software package had no problem, the problem appeared
 on the hardware!
