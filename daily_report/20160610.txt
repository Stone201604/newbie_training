    Today I had made some understanding about boot.img:
    Some of the popular understanding, switch on the mobile phone baseband detection
 can not to call, and then like a Windows XP computer to you as a selection interface
, into the system, or a key ghost, of course, the phone is directly into the system,
 ghost, then you need a push button and then re. At this time the HBOOT has both the
 BIOS and the system to select the function of the interface, recovery is similar to
 the function of the ghost.
    S-off in, whether it is white cards ('ship s-off) or soft solution (Eng s-off), 
ROM, the boot.img and system together brush into your mobile phone to, this is because
 of the safety lock is closed, allowing you to change including radio, the first screen,
 re even HBOOT can. As long as there is something in the ROM, can be used to brush into,
 do not need separate operation. Cite a simple example, folder through the process to 
extract the rom.zip inside the RUU file. This file contains the baseband, kernel, re,
 the first screen, the system and so on almost all mobile phone software, even you
 can upgrade (i.e. HTC commonly used PXXXX.zip format card brush file), can be used
 existing HBOOT to update new HBOOT, how do you say this is like you reinstall the 
XP system a vista system, restart, the XP disappeared into the vista. So, Rom compression
 package inside the boot in the brush ROM will be together with the brush into.
