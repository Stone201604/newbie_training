     Today continued to solve the problem of QP200GA 4800:
     Some people judged it was the start of WiFi, from the power supply to start to
 complete the required time was too long, it need to grab this time by using the 
commands: adb wait-for-device  
 adb shell getprop dev.bootcomplete 
     A total of 6pcs, found that about 4 in 65s, 1 in 95s, one in 40s. and grab
 the logs by using the commands:
   adb logcat -v time; adb shell cat /proc/kmsg 
     At the beginning of the test, that grab log need to restart the computer, 
so did these and it took much time. Later found that grab log is not necessary 
to restart the computer, because it was to grab the phone log!
