   The major thing of today is to deploy the buid-essential of Android 4.4 
kitkat,the main thing to do is to deploy JDK and SSH. I ask it ok or not that 
the system have only the root directory,Zhou  responses that it isn't good 
because the system is reinstalled in case. Its datas would  all be lost !And I
 have to reinstall it again. It is favourably reinstalled. The most difficult 
thing of today is to find id_rsa.pub,Peopele on the internet say the file is in
 the /root catalog,but I am fail to find it although I have used many methods! 
 I swap my thought that many materials indicate that the filemust be in the 
SSH ,and I press cd ~/.ssh,after entering the SSH, pressing  vi id_rsa.pub,
and happily finding the content of the file! Following ,pressing ctrl+shift+c 
 to copy the content in the terminal.And then press ctrl+v in the SSH setting 
of github.Test it and find it has been setted ok ! I try to understand the using
 of vi, press  vi id_rsa.pub  in the /home. Find it is a new file other than 
the original file.and the new file is not the file I need! And I feel it makes
 me deeper understand the using of vi!
