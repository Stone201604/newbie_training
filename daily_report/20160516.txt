    Today I started to translate a windows.bat into the Linux script, so the first
general understanding of the difference between the two:
    Batch processing is used to automatically execute commands in batches to 
implement specific actions.
   Windows is commonly used MS-DOS commands.Linux commonly used batch is a shell
 script, shell in the Linux has a variety of types, which are the most commonly 
used Bourne shell(SH),C shell (CSH) and Korn shell(KSH) .
   To learn how to write a batch script, you must first be familiar with the 
command. Such as: windows to be familiar with the MS-DOS command.Linux to be 
familiar with the commonly used linux commands.To a more advanced when you can
 use Perl, python, Java, PHP and other languages to achieve the function of the
 regular command can not be achieved.
   In Windows batch processing is.bat and.cmd for the extension of the file.And
 Linux is often.sh, and some do not have the extension of the file.
