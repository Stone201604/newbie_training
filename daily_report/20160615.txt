   The format and methods of the linux command ¡°chown¡±. name: chown ,access: root
   Usage: chown [-cfhvR] [--help] [--version] user[:group] file...
   Use chown to change the owner of the file. This directive is only used by the system
 manager (root), the general user has no right to change the file owner of someone else,
 there is no access to their own file owners to other people. Only the system manager 
(root) has such authority.
   Parameter: -c or -change: similar to -v, but only part of the modified
         -f or - quiet or - Silent: do not display error messages
         -h or - no-dereference: only the symbolic link to the file to do the 
modification, and do not change any other relevant documents
         -recursive or -R: recursive processing, will specify the directory of all
 files and sub directories together
         -v or - verbose: display instruction execution process
         - help: display online description
         - reference=< reference file or Directory >: the owner of the specified 
file or directory, and the group, are all set to the same as the owner of the 
reference file or directory.
         - version: display version information the chown command using, for 
example: (like with my VPS, we must first SSH login) # chown [-R] [user name]
 [file or directory] # chown[-R] [user name: group name] [file or directory]
   Example 1: the test3.txt file is changed to test users.
   # ls -l test3.txt
   -rw-r - r - 1 root test 0 2016-6-19 9:59 test3.txt
   # chowntest:root test3.txt
   # ls -l test3.txt
   -rw-r - r - 1 root test 0 2016-6-19 9:59
   The new genus 2:chown is connected with the new group. The connection, one 
of the main groups and one group can be empty. If the owner is empty, it should
 be ": a group"; if the group is empty, ":" you can not bring.
   # ls -l test3.txt
   -rw-r - r - 1 root test 0 2016-6-19 9:59 test3.txt 
   # chown: Test test3.txt <== to group file test3.txt to test
   # ls -l test3.txt
   -rw-r - r - 1 test test 0 2016-6-19 9:59 test3.txt
