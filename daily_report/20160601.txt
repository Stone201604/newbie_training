    Today I had deeply understood the usage of the linux command  ¡°find¡±:
1, the general form of the find command is;
Pathname -options [-print -exec -ok find...]
2, find command parameters;
Find pathname: command to find the directory path. For example, to indicate the 
current directory, use / to represent the system root directory.
-print:find command will match the file output to the standard output.
-exec:find command to match the file to execute the parameters given by the shell
 command. The corresponding command in the form of'command'{}; note {} and; space 
between.
The same -ok: and - exec role, but in a more safe mode to perform the parameters
 given by the shell command, before executing a command, will give tips, allowing 
the user to determine whether to perform.
3, find command options
-name
File name lookup.
-perm
File permissions to find files.
-prune
Use this option to make the find command is not currently in the specified directory
 to find, if you use the -depth option at the same time, then the find will be ignored
 by the -prune command.
-user
Find files according to the file owner.
-group
Search files according to the group of files.
-n +n -mtime
In accordance with the time to change the file to find the file, - n said the change
 in time from now n days, + n said the document change time from now n days ago. The
 find command also has -atime and -ctime options, but both of them and the time -m option.
-nogroup
Finds a file that does not have a valid group, that is, the group that belongs to the
 file does not exist in the /etc/groups.
-nouser
To find a file that is not valid for the owner, that is, the owner of the file does
 not exist in the /etc/passwd.
-newer File1!File2
Find change time newer than the File1 but older than the File2.
-type
Looking for a certain type of file, such as:
B - block device file.
D - directory.
C - character device file.
P - Pipeline file.
L - symbolic link file.
F - General file.
N:[c] -size to find the file length of N blocks of the file, with C, said the length of the file in bytes. -depth: when you find a file, you first look up the files in the current directory, and then find the file in its sub directory.
-fstype: find in files of a certain type of file system, the file system type can usually be found in the configuration file in / etc / fstab, the system related to the file system information contained in the configuration file.
-mount: don't cross file system mount point when looking for files.
-follow: if the find command is encountered with a symbolic link file, trace the file to the link.
-cpio: to use the CPIO command for the matching file, back up the files to the tape device.
