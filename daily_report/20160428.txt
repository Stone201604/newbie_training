   Consecutive 10 days sent daily_report to github, all used on the win8 github
 for windows. Today I tried a Linux system to send the development plan that
 had not yet been uploaded on github . Found very interesting places: can be
 carried out smoothly git add and git commit command, after enter the git push
 command ,tooltip updated can not effect the original update update in another
 local library, the Linux native libraries without the update file. So according
 to the prompt git pull and download the new_bie training/daily_report report of
 github, all the updated files downloaded to the Linux computer local disk, and 
then enter the git commit get success! Then git push the file successfully
 uploaded to github! 
    Enter the server, input\\10.42.100.15\sw_rd in windows system,  input 
smb://10.42.100.15/sw_rd in  linux system.Because in the back of the rd plus $, 
always say no permissions! Old colleagues remember the original need to add $, 
and it spent one or two hours.
