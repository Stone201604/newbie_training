    Today I had deeplier understood the usage of the linux command "chmod":
Format  Chmod  permissions  to modify the permissions in the file Linux are as follows:
r: read; w: write; x: execute.
-rw------- (600) - only the master has read and write permissions.
-rw-r--r-- (644) - only the master has read and write permissions, and a group of
 users and other users only read permissions.
-rwx------ (700) - only the master has read, write, and execute.
-rwxr-xr-x (755) - the master has read, write and execute permissions; and a group
 of users and other users only read and execute permissions.
-rwx--x--x (711) - the master has read, write and execute permissions, and the 
group of users and other users only the executive authority.
-rw-rw-rw- (666) - all users have file read and write permissions. This approach
 is not desirable.
-rwxrwxrwx (777) - all users have access to read, write, and execute. More 
undesirable to do.9 corresponding to the 777 are the main reading, writing, executive
 authority; and the group of users and other users to read, write and execute permissions.
Allows a permission on the set of 1777 (8 hex) =111111111 (2 hex), 9 are set one,
 that is, all rights are open command: Chmod 700 a.c
