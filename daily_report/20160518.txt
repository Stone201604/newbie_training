    Today, I practiced and reinforced the understanding of the usage of the 
source command:
source FileName
    Function: reads and executes commands in FileName in the current bash environment.
Note: this command is usually used as a command.
    .bash_rc source and.Bash_rc are equivalent.
Note: the difference between the shell command and the scripts source is:
  Source in the current bash environment to execute the command, and scripts is 
to start a sub shell to execute the command. Such if the set environment variables
 (or alias and so on) the write commands in scripts, it will only affect the shell, 
can not change the current bash, so through the file (command line) to set 
environment variables, use the source command.
