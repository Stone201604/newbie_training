     Today I had made some understanding about boot.img:
     Simply said, boot.img contains two parts, respectively, kernel and ramdisk.
 When you start the phone will start the first RADIO, and then SPL. This SPL will 
according to your keys, determined to enter the which mode (e.g. recovery FastBoot,
 etc.), if there is no press other keys, then SPL will load the kernel into memory,
 ramdisk can be loaded into the root directory of your device.
     I said under the personal understanding, boot.img which contains the kernel
 memory and data, kernel point like a car's engine, the data memory is similar to
 boot, the boot after the tell each software what to do, such as the screen is 
driven to display Boot second screen animation, welcome interface, desktop etc.; 
sound driver to prepare startup sound and so on. First start radio, and then enter
 the HBOOT interface, if there is no button, will enter the system directly, there 
is a button, you will enter the selection interface.
