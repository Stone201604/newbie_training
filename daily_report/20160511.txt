    Today I burned the TC70CR again, before encountered a problem: using the 
original TC70CRimage that put in Jimmy PC. The FDRROOT that done out on my 
windows always only had 104M, and the size of normal made out of TC70CR had 521M.
 Could be sure to be a problem. And comparison of various,using the factoryimage.bin
 that had been donein jimmyPC . Then I made Factoryimage_7521.bin on my windows phone.
using the Factoryimage_7521.bin generate the size of FDRROOT was 521M, that proved 
my task software configuration and operation was no problem. Then the problem was
 generated in the factoryimage.bin. QPST, EMMC on the operation were performed in
 accordance with SOP, then the operation does not exist, only maybe the problem of 
the package IMAGE itself . So got the original package image , while deleted  the
 four _test files in it, on my linuxPC to do it again. Do a good job after the
 operation on the windowsPC again, the size of the FDRROOT had 521M, from this
 point ,It  was successful, and it could be sure that I got IMAGE on jimmyPC was
 not TC70CR!
     There was also found a little , factoryimage.bin generated in the jimmyPC had
 11G, and in my windows pc only 7.34G and illustrate different computers, although
 qpst software was installed in the same, the generated file size had some 
differences!
