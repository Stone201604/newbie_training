   ~ represents your /home/ user directory
   If your username is x, then ~/ is /home/x/
   Is representative of the directory itself, but generally can not write.
   So cd ~/.and cd~ and cd ~ / and the effect is the same.
But there is something behind it is another problem, the point in the file name 
of the head, representing a hidden file.
   ~/.local is the path to a.Local folder in your home directory, and it can be 
seen that this is a hiding file, if not -a ls, the general ls is not able to 
see it.
