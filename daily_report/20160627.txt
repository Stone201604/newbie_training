   C language is a general-purpose computer programming language, a wide range
 of applications. The design goal of the C language is to provide a programming 
language that can be compiled, processed in a simple manner, produced a small 
amount of machine code, and can run without any runtime environment support.
   In spite of the C language provides many lower level processing function, 
but still maintained a good cross platform characteristic, written in a standard
 C language program can be compiled on many computer platforms, even including 
some embedded processor (MCU or MCU) and super computer operation platform.
   In the eighties of the twentieth century, in order to avoid the manufacturer
 with the C language syntax differences, by the United States National Bureau 
of standards for the C language stipulate the a complete set of international 
standard grammar, said to ANSI C, as the first standard for the C language.
