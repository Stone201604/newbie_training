   Today, in the forenoon, I install the win7 system to my third notebook computer.
in the first way, use the usb flash dish to install  the win7 by the UltralSO 
production , but to enter the BIOS and into the usb disk to start after click 
on any one option are unable to continue, most of them are similar that it cannot
load file and marks failing  tips, some people on the Internet have said may be
U disk boot file problems, said the image file is not complete and lack of starting
the first problem; I think may be U disk boot file problems, then download the 
pocket U disk software used to remake U disk boot disk, then according to the
corresponding tutorial take ran successfully !
In the afternoon, there was a question about the script before I noticed it:
First, the script needs to be executed
chmod u+x file.sh 
There are three ways to execute scripts:
1 ./file.sh
Features: open the child process of the bash to perform, which is open additional 
processes to perform and does not affect the original process variables,the 
configuration and so on.
2  bash file.sh
Features: the same as./file.sh
3 source file.sh or .file.sh.
Features: execute the script in the original bash process.
The third methods are mainly used in the script to switch the user su, switch
directory cd and other commands.The command source is the same as . !
