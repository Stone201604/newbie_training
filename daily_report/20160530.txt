      There was a problem that camera sharpness test fail about TC70GA1
       
      We found the root cause is the factory image¡¯s?camera UI setting 
not correct.
     The sharpness default setting should be 3 not 2.
     And modified it in the system.img,and then rebuilt it.lastly we need 
to verify it by the TC70GA1 machine!
