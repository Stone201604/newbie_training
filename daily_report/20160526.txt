    Today continued to solve the problem of QP200GA 4800:
    Taipei SW rebuilt the userdata.img,system.img and boot.img, and then burned 
it into two pieces of 15nmEMMC, per pcs tested 4 times, found that it was not 
stable, but most of the time, or in the 65s. And  then burned it to two pieces 
of 19nmEMMC, then each of the four tests and found it almost stabled in the 55s.
 However, it was only the 40s when 19nmEMMC installed 19nmIMG, indicating that 
this version of img was indeed problematic.
    Today, the operation of the computer because it did not need to restart the
 computer, so the test and LOG time spent less than the first time!  this test 
data was posted on the corresponding board, I felt it may be useful in the next 
time!
