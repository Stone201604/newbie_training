     About Windows script
     In a broad sense, Windows script is a relatively large concept, it includes
 Jscript, VBScript, Windows scripting host, Windows scripting components, remote
 scripting and Script controls, and other techniques.
     In a narrow sense, the Windows script is what we usually say. Here the Windows
 Script also refers to this concept, the following such as no special instructions
 are referred to this concept.Windows Script is actually a text file, called the 
suffix ". bat", can also be ". cmd" (. bat is DOS batch files and. cmd is  a batch
 processing file of NT kernel command line environment). Most of the content of this
 text file is actually a line of DOS commands, you can use any text editing tools to
 create and modify. In addition to the DOS command, the Windows script has some of
 its own private commands and syntax!
