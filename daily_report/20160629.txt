   Language features
   Basic characteristics
   1, high-level language: it is the basic structure of the advanced language and
 the language of the basic structure and the combination of the work unit.  
   2, structural language: structural language is a significant feature of the 
separation of the code and data, that is, the various parts of the program in 
addition to the necessary information to communicate with each other independent.
 This structured approach can make the program level clear, easy to use, maintain
 and debug. C language is provided to the user in the form of function, these
 functions can be easily called, and has a variety of circulation, conditional 
statements control program flow, so that the program is fully structured.
   3, code level cross platform: as a result of the existence of standards, 
making almost the same C code can be used for a variety of operating systems,
 such as Windows, DOS, UNIX, etc., also applies to a variety of models. C 
language for the preparation of the need for hardware operation of the occasion,
 better than other high-level language.
   4, the use of pointers: you can directly close to the hardware operation, but
 the C pointer operation is not done, but also to bring a lot of unsafe factors.
 C + + in this area has been improved, while retaining the pointer operations at
 the same time and enhance the safety, supported by some users, however, because 
of the complexity of these improvements increase language, another part is criticized.
 Java learned the lessons of C + +, cancel the pointer operation, also cancelled to
 improve c + + in some controversial place, and good results are obtained in the 
safety and suitability, but its interpretation is running in the virtual machine,
 operating efficiency is lower than that of C / C. Generally speaking, C, C++, and
 Java are regarded as the same language, they have long occupied the top three of
 the list.
