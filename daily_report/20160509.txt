    I found some problems in the operation process of generating factoryimage.bin:
    Thefirst: after running the command fastboot erase sbl1 the shutdown state can 
be connected to the Qualcomm HS-USB Diagnostics 9006
Before erasing sbl1 directly shutdown the phone, the display of the MTU device,
    it displayed the driver was not successful!
The second: during running emmcswdownload.exe -F factoryimage.bin ,you must run 
CMD with administrator privileges, or cause errors, can not be download.
