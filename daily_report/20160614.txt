    Use Linux virtual machines, and sometimes, for example, when the Ping network 
needs to close the firewall
    At that time how can not think of the way to close the firewall.
    Now write down the way to close the Linux firewall:
    1 immediate effect, after the restart failure
     Open:service iptables start 
     Close: service iptables stop 
    2 after the restart effect
     Open: chkconfig iptables on 
     Close: chkconfig iptables off
