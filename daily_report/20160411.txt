  The most important thing of today is to install Ubuntu14.04.1 system,using
the easybcd installs the system by HDD,and it needs to install again after 
restarting.searching about it in the internet,many methods,but I don't find the 
suitable solution;so I decide to try to install it by USB flash disk,but I don't
find the starter of the USB flash disk although I have installed neogrub.Jiang sir
comes in time ,pressing F12 during starting,and then find the USB flash disk 
in the BIOS.Installing the system,but I find it boring that  it also needs to 
install again after restarting.unhappy a moment,I have to solve it anyway.
 I find a solution that it needs to add starter in the easybcd. Trying it! 
And enter the win10 at first,adding starter in the easybcd,and then restart.
I am very happy because that I don't catch the sight of  installing ubuntu.click it
 to enter the ubuntu system! And I feel proud in the moment!
