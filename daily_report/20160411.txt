  The most important thing of today is that installing Ubuntu14.04.1,after using
the easybcd install the system by HDD,and need to install again after restarting.
searching about it in the internet,many mathod,but I don't find the suitable 
solution;so I  decide to try to install it by USB flash disk,but I don't  find 
the starter of the USB flash disk although I have installed neogrub.Jiang sir
 comes in time ,pressing F12 during starting,and then find the USB flash disk 
in the BIOS.Installing the system,but I find it boring that  it also needs to 
install again after restarting.unhappy a moment,I have to solve it anyway.
 I find a solution that it need to add starter in the easybcd. Trying it! 
And enter the win10 at first,adding starter in the easybcd,and then restart.
I am happy because that I don't catch the sight of  installing ubuntu.click it
 to enter the ubuntu system! And I feel proud in the moment!
