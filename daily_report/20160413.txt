     The major thing of today is to amend system.img,amend the date of the buid
 to be 20160413.at first,it needs to install adb and fastboot.it is worth to say
 in this time that it needs to make a new file of 51-android.rules.I think it 
may be randomly named so that I name it 44-android.rules. In the moment I make
 the test by using my own mobile phone,and it is also failing. Zhou says it may
 be the name's issue. And it is really successful after I change the name to be
51-android.rules!the adb and fastboot are perfectly installed at last.there are
many paths about the files,and it is slowly added by one and one, I find a better
method that it drags the related file to the terminal after pressing cd+space,
and then press the enter.Today is a full day!
