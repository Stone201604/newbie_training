      Single quotes and double quotes 
      Single quotes and double quotes the biggest difference is that double quotes
 can still keep the content of variables, but only inside the single quotes can be
 General characters, and no special symbols. We use the following example to illustrate:
 if you define a variable,Name=VBird, now want to name the content of this variable
 defines myname and display the VBird  its me  .How do you set up the content?

      [root@linux ~]# name=VBird 
      [root@linux ~]# echo $name 
       VBird 
      [root@linux ~]# myname="$name its me" 
      [root@linux ~]# echo $myname 
       VBird its me 
      [root@linux ~]# myname='$name its me' 
      [root@linux ~]# echo $myname 
       $name its me 
      Did you find out? you 're right£¡ Using single quotes, then $name will lose the
 original variable content, The general character of the display type! Special care 
must be required here!

      Command substitution is the shell that can insert a command's standard output
 in a command line. Shell there are two methods for command substitution: the shell
 command with the anti quotes or $(...) structure, including the $(...) format is 
supported by the POSIX standard, but also conducive to nesting.
