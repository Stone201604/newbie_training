Things that are in trouble today:
     Download SSH, permission connection is always prompted denied please, try again.
 TC70CR originally thought that this is the SSH configuration problem, so once again
 configured ssh. Well configured, or can not be under the TC70CR! Thought before 
also downloaded qp200, so try again, can under, which makes it very strange ah!
 But downloading TC70CR is always a failure! Later, Zhouzhou configured accounts
 to the SSH, Download TC70CR was found to be permission denied! However, Zhouzhou
 account in his notebook can download TC70CR, indicating that his account 
permissions problem does not exist! This feeling no language ah. After Zhouzhou
 to modify a lot of places, he said almost all with his computer on SSH configured
 exactly the same, after spending three hours after getting up at last can download
 the TC70CR codes!
