    Today I had deeply understood the usage of the linux command  ¡°read¡±:
effect
Read a line from the standard input.
grammar
Read [] [] [] [-p -r -s]] -u[n [VariableName Prompt]?
[VariableName...]
describe
The read command reads a line from the standard input, and specifies the value of
 each field of the input line to the shell variable, using the character in the 
IFS (internal field separator) variable as the separator. The VariableName parameter 
specifies the name of the shell variable, and the shell variable gets the value of a
 field for the input row. Specify values for each field specified by the parameter of
 the VariableName first shell variables, specified by the parameter of the VariableName
second shell variables specified values for the second field, and so on, until finally
 a field. If the standard input lines of the field than corresponding specified by the
 parameter of the VariableName shell variables for multiple, put all the rest of the 
field value is assigned to a specified final shell variables. If the number is less
 than the shell variable, the remaining shell variable is set to an empty string.
Note: if the VariableName parameter is omitted, the variable REPLY is used as the 
default variable name.
The shell variable that is set by the read command affects the current shell execution
 environment.
sign
-p |&amp; (mark name &amp; pipeline) reads the output run by the Korn shell process as input.
Note: the end of the file in the -p flag causes the process to clear, so another process
 is generated.
-r specifies a read command to a \ (backslash) as a part of the input line, and do not 
put it as a control character.
-s saves the input as a command in the shell Korn's history file.
-u [n] to read a number of file description symbol code n as input. File descriptor can
 be opened with exec KSH built in command. The default value of n is 0, which indicates
 the keyboard. Value 2 indicates a standard error.
parameter
VariableName? Prompt specifies the name of a variable and a prompt to use. When Korn 
shell is interactive, it will prompt written to standard error, and perform input. 
Prompt contains more than one word that must be enclosed in single or double quotes.
VariableName... Specifies one or more variable names separated by spaces.
