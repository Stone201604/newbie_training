    Today's work is mainly about the issue of QP200GA last Friday, for this problem, 
probably know the problem is to appear in two minutes. Today Taipei there asked me 
to help catch the log, used the command adb logcat - v time > log.txt. afternoon, 
by PM organization conference calls, meeting with people think that is a problem 
in the OS and start an ADB, phone also start, Bluetooth, WiFi to start, in the 
start-up process takes time, for QP200GA may need 60 to 80s, so proposed short-term 
measures, after the power delay 80s test-retest RF, but this was opposition from the
 factory representative, or asked to solve the fundamental problem.
