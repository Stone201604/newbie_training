     Today's main work is Linux commonly used commands, this process has found 
that these days did not pay attention to some of the commands, such as:
PWD  displays the current directory
Head, tail display file header, tail content
Ctrl+alt+F1/F5  command line full screen mode
Ctrl+alt+F7  exit command line full screen mode
Ctrl+d  exits the current command mode
df  view disk size -h df  with unit display disk information
ifconfig  view network situation
ping  test network connectivity
netstat  display network status information / / no space between net and stat
man command will not be used, to find a man such as: LS //man man is a view to
 help document the command
clear //clear screen
shutdown
Need to enter the root user //sudo -s   -r restart//shutdown -r now immediately
restart; shutdown -r +3 //shutdown after three minutes  and then restart 
Now  immediately shut down now //shutdown is unable to fully shut down the power
of the key light, the screen also lit!
Note: the interrupt command, after the execution of the command (if not to the
background), you can use the ctrl+c to suspend the order, where the press will 
cancel the shutdown.
