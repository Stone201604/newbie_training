    Android system architecture and its operating system, the use of a layered 
architecture.
From the perspective of architecture, Android is divided into four layers, from
 the top to the low layer is the application layer, application framework layer, 
the system runs the library layer and the Linux kernel layer.
    Application program

package includes the client, SMS short message program, calendar, maps, browser, 
contacts management program, etc.. All applications are written using the JAVA 
language.
    Application framework
Developers can also complete access to the API framework used by the core 
application. The application of architecture design simplifies the component
 reuse; any application can be released its function block and any other 
applications can use function block of the issued but must follow the framework
 of security). Similarly, the application reuse mechanism also allows users to
 easily replace the program components.
    Hidden behind each application is a series of services and systems, including:
    A rich and extensible view that can be used to build applications that include 
lists, grids, text boxes, buttons, and even embedded web browsers.
    The content provider allows applications to access data from another application, 
such as a contact database, or to share their own data
    Resource manager provides access to non code resources, such as local strings,
 graphics, and layout files.
    Notification manager allows an application to display a custom prompt message
 in the status bar.
    Activity manager to manage the application life cycle and provides a common 
navigation rollback function.
