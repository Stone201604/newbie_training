    Today I had known some knowledge about LINUX SYSTEM!
    Linux is a set of free and free use of the class Unix operating system, is a POSIX 
and UNIX based on multi user, multi tasking, support multi threading and multi CPU 
operating system. It can run the main UNIX tool software, applications and network 
protocols. It supports 32 bit and 64 bit hardware. Linux inherits the Unix to the 
network as the core of the design idea, is a stable performance of the multi user 
network operating system.
    Linux operating system was born in October 5, 1991 (this is the first official
 release of the time). Linux there are many different Linux versions, but they all
 use the Linux kernel. Linux can be installed in a variety of computer hardware 
devices, such as mobile phones, tablet computers, routers, video game consoles, desktop
 computers, mainframe computers and supercomputers.
    Strictly speaking, the word Linux itself only represents the Linux kernel, but 
in fact people have been accustomed to using Linux to describe the entire Linux 
based kernel, and the use of GNU engineering tools and database operating system.
