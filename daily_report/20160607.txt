      An embedded system usually consists of embedded computer system and the 
implementation of device composition, embedded computer system is the core of 
the whole embedded system consists of hardware layer, middle layer, the system 
software layer and application software layer composition. The execution device 
is also called the controlled object, which can accept the control command issued
 by the embedded computer system, and the operation or the task is performed. 
Actuators can be very simple, such as the mobile phone of a micro motor, when the
 mobile phone is in the vibration receiving state open; can also very complex, 
such as Sony intelligent machine dog, integrated the above the plurality of micro
 motor control and a variety of sensors, which can perform a variety of complex 
actions and feelings of various state information
     The hardware layer contains embedded microprocessor, memory (SDRAM, ROM, Flash,
 etc.), universal device interface and I/O interface (A/D, D/A, I/O, etc.). On the 
basis of an embedded processor, a power supply circuit, a clock circuit and a memory
 circuit are added to form an embedded core control module. The operating system
 and the application can be solidified in the ROM.
     Between the hardware layer and the software layer as middle layer, also known 
as for the hardware abstraction layer (hardware abstract layer, HAL) or board level
 support board support package (BSP) package, it will separate from the upper system
 software and hardware, the underlying system driver and hardware independent, the
 upper software developers do not need to care about the specific circumstances of
 the underlying hardware, BSP layer provides the interface can be developed according
 to the. The layer generally contains the underlying hardware initialization, data 
input / output operation and the configuration of the hardware device.
