     Today I toughed a problem.
  Workshop of 50 pieces of the new version of OS QP200 with WWAN driven machines
 for RF test, of which there are 8 pcs with WWAN driven machine test unable to pass.
 4800 of mistakes, with the GA driven machine 8 pcs were able to pass. However, the
 drive the need for other two minutes can be identified to the USB.
    After a lot of validation, the first ,for GA drive read too long:
    In the original machine, after unloading the corresponding drive in accordance 
with the SOP reload, reading is still needed 2min;
    In a new machine is not installed on the new machine in accordance with the SOP
 reinstall, read around 28s, with 4pcs verification are so;
    Explain the problem of driving delay in the installation of the drive!
The second: in view of these 8 in the WWAN driver can quickly read but all appear 
in 4800 of the situation
    We took 4 in the original GA driver test, all passed;
    Then each piece on the WWAN driven machine, after the first identification and 
waited 2min,all pass; and then directly to the factory after the direct test, are 
4800; finally in recognition and waited for 2min test, and all pass.
    We can identify the problem in these two minutes, however, the deep-seated 
problems still need to be analyzed!
