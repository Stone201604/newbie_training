   Today I continue to configure the environment of preburn_image TC75, but the 
previous operation on the Ubuntu system has to operate on the win7. Then stuck in
the driver installation here, original feel very basic things, out of the question
colleagues similar SOP is useless, the SOP is mainly speak to install the 
corresponding certificate, in the five corresponding driver installation, so after
a good deal or failure. This problem remains to be solved, the first use of a 
colleague's win7 computer to continue to configure and achieve the purpose of 
making factory_image.bin!
   In the image directory generation factoryimage.bin file in which the process I 
find the original in the revision of the rawprogram0.xml I modified three should 
not modify the file name, the three original are recovery.img, boot.img, 
userdata.img; I change them into the recovery_test1.img, boot_test1.img 
userdata_test1.img. Led to the factoryimage.bin can not be generated, it successes
after they are changed back!
