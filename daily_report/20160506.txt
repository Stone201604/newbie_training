      In operation today continues to generate TC70CR factoryimage.bin met the 
problem, it was still drive problems, although the day before yesterday drive
 would have been installed. However, it is not good again! And this time even
 the mouse USB are prompted to connect to the mouse driver installation is not
 successful! It's almost silent! May be poisoned, and then reinstall the system,
 the use of the driver wizard loaded with the basic computer driven, followed 
by SOP installed TC70CR drive!it succeed after the installation had been completed. 
      This afternoon and evening in the shop to deal with a problem, Scott (TE )
said TC70CR brush this version of the latest image, connecting the new machine,
 the installation of the driver when installed directly damaged! That is, the 
drive does not match the same time can not be installed at the other driver! 
Strange that those who have installed TC70GA or TC70CR before the version of 
the computer plug can be identified and read out. Later I asked him how to 
install the driver, he said directly to find the directory before Google_usb
 directory  to let it find their own installation, and I remember that I have
 had such a installation, often fail! SOP operation is to choose to install 
the google-usb directory, so find a four NB that did not install the Android
 system to drive the computer, according to SOP installation can be installed 
directly. And it verified the original conjecture!
