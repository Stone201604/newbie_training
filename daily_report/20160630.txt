   Unique characteristics
   C language is a structured programming, with variable scope of action (scope 
variable) and recursive function of the process language.
   C language transfer parameters are by value (pass), the other can also pass 
the pointer (pointer passed a value by).
   Different variable types can be combined with the structure (struct).
   Only 32 reserved words (keywords reserved), so that variables, the name of
the function is more flexible.
   Partial variable types can be converted, such as integer and character variables.
   Through the pointer (pointer), C language can be easy to low-level control of memory.
   Pre compiled processing (preprocessor) so that the C language compiler more flexible.
